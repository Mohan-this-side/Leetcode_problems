    "We mentioned earlier that in most languages, strings are immutable. This means concatenating a single character to a string is an \n",

    "Many problems will ask you to return a string, and usually, this string will be built during the algorithm. Let's say the final string is of length n and we build it one character at a time with concatenation. What would the time complexity be? The operations needed at each step would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. This is the partial sum of this series, which leads to \n",

    "Simple concatenation will result in an O(n^2) time complexity if you are using a language where strings are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are better ways to build strings in just O(n) time. This will vary between languages - here, we'll talk about Python and Java - if you're using another language, we recommend researching the best way to build strings in your language."
