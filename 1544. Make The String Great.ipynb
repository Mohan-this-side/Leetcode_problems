    "\n",
    "0 <= i <= s.length - 2\n",
    "s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.\n",
    "To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.\n",
