    "A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).\n",

    "The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.\n",
    "The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.\n",
